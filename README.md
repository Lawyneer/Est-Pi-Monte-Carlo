# Est-Pi-Monte-Carlo
Estimate Pi using Monte Carlo Methods

I know this is a trival example to anybody that has studied Monte Carlo Methods/Simulations or coded with Matlab.

The example is being provided to:
  1) give me a chance to play around with GitHub; and
  2) show a simple example for anybody beginning to study Monte Carlo Methods or Matlab.
